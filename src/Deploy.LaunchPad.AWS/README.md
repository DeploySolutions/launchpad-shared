"We build Great Space Apps, for the World®"

Deploy Solutions connects Earth Observation data with downstream business needs by providing innovative Space Apps — software applications which use data from space.
Since 2019, we have worked with hundreds of students, citizens, NGOs, scientists, and government officials to identify top communication problems getting citizens to act on climate change risks. We have gathered unprecedented insights which we share at https://fight.climatechange.ca.
